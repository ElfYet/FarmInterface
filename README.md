# FarmInterface

GUI for a Farm Dashboard that aids farmers in automating a DJI drone that utilizes
a Arduino/Microbit device loaded with sensors to help farmers get one step closer to fully automating
their farms. With a single click they are able to manage farm items, visit items, scan the farm, create
a farm layout, check soil moisture/crop growth, water plants, and identifing unwanted moving objects. 

By using C# .NET Windows Forms to create a dashboard separated into three main sections. The 'Farm Items'
give the farmer an array of items and item containers to add to the 'Visualization' panel, which allows the
user to see the farm layout, as well as drone activity. Additionally, these farm items can be added, edited
and deleted with ease. The 'Arduino/Microbit Device Actions' is responsible for controlling the drone itself.
